# Intro to graph

## Brief explanation of what is Graph

Microsoft Graph is an API built in Office 365 that allows developers to integrate with devices, Office 365 and Azure and develop more intelligent and productive applications.

Thanks to Microsoft Graph we can integrate services such as Azure AD, OneDrive, Outlook, Excel, OneNote, Intune, SharePoint or Planner among others.
  
The best thing about Graph is that the integration is simple via API REST, with very few lines of code you can have access to a large amount of information to consume it or to modify it.

## Why its usefulness

Microsoft Graph, by allowing us to connect with all our Office 365 data, allows us to integrate this data into our applications easily, quickly and safely.

Thanks to this Microsoft Grpah allows us to implement:

 - Sends alerts if you're spending too much time in meetings.
 - Suggest the best time for the next team meeting scan your calendar.
 - Create a Team in Microsoft Teams for an existing office 365 Group
 - Send a notification when people are added to Active Directory and automatically kick off employee on-boarding workflows.
 -  Continue wiht a doucment in other device just you left off.
 - Create a tiemline wiht all your activity. 
   
These are some examples of what can be done with grpah, but you can see there are many scenarios where you can apply.
