# What will this lab cover

In this lab, you'll learn how to use Machine Learning APIs and services on the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge.

## Intelligent cloud: Machine Learning as a service

As one of the many offerings under Microsoft Azure's paradigm of PaaS (Platform as a Service), Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is an array of services that provides machine learning tools in the cloud. MLaaS mitigates infrastructural concerns such as data pre-processing, model training, model evaluation, and ultimately, predictions, and clients can take advantage of machine learning without the cost, time, and risk of establishing an in-house machine learning team.

Azure Cognitive Services is an example of MLaaS. Cognitive Services simplifies the process of building, deploying and improving a classifiers by providing REST APIs and a web interface for training classifiers. In this lab, you'll try out two Cognitive Services: Face APIs and Custom Vision.

## Intelligent edge: Windows Machine Learning

Windows ML provides hardware-accelerated evaluation of machine learning models on Windows 10 devices, allowing developers to use machine learning in Windows applications. By leveraging the device's GPU or CPU, Windows ML enables high-performance evaluation of both classical ML and Deep Learning algorithms. Local, on-device evaluation removes concerns of bandwith, connectivity, and privacy, and also enables low latency and high performance for quick evaluation results on the edge.

In this lab, you'll learn how to use Windows ML APIs in your Windows applications to evaluate various machine learning models trained in Azure's MLaaS.
