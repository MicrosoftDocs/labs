# PWA foundations

### What is a PWA?

Technologically speaking, PWAs are just websites, enhanced using modern design and web technologies (Responsive Design, Touch Friendly, Service Workers, Fetch networking, Cache API, Push notifications, Web App Manifest) to provide a more native app-like experience.

### Manifest, Service Worker, Secure:
To create a PWA the website will need: a manifest, service workers, and be on Https:

   + Standard Manifest:  The site should be controlled by a W3C manifest that determines the experience and behavior of your PWA. This includes everything from images, to language, or the start page of your web app.

   + Service workers: The Progressive Web App should have a mechanism (e.g. through a service worker) to help control traffic when the network isn’t there or isn’t reliable. The app should be able to work independent of network.

   + Secure: A secure connection (HTTPS) over your site makes sure all traffic is as safe as a native app. A secure endpoint also allows the service worker to securely take action on the behalf of your app.

## Running across platforms

### Supported Platforms:

Since at their core PWAs are still websites, they’re already supported on numerous platforms like Windows, Android, iOS, and Mac. They can be enhanced over time to function more like native apps, and even use native APIs, on supported platforms.  This can turn your website into a Rockstar app by combining the best of the web and native application worlds.  Plus, the work of turning your website into a PWA can also improve your website’s experience.

### Running PWA in a browser:

PWAs aren't very different that a web application, when you access to a PWA you will see the same as a simple web application.
