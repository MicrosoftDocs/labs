## Build Service Worker

During this step you will choose functionalities you want to add to your app. The builder will include code to use sample service workers implementing those features from a repository. *[Learn more about service workers](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/what/is/a/pwa/2018/02/03/what-is-a-service-worker.html).*
There are a number of service workers to choose from on this page, but Knowzy is looking for a way to make sure its field agents can access the app data when they have poor or no network connection.

1. For this functionality we'll choose the "Cache-first network" service worker.
