# PWA foundations

### What is a PWA?
Progressive Web Apps are just great web sites that can behave like native apps—or, perhaps, Progressive Web Apps are just great apps, powered by Web technologies and delivered with Web infrastructure.
Technologically speaking, PWAs are web apps, progressively enhanced with modern web technologies (Service Worker, Fetch networking, Cache API, Push notifications, Web App Manifest) to provide a more app-like experience.

### Manifest, Service Worker, Https:
To create a PWA the website will need to be Responsive, a manifest, service workers, and be on a Https:

   + Standard Manifest:  The site should be controlled by a W3C manifest that determines the experience and behavior of your PWA. This includes everything from images, to language, or the start page of your web app.

   + Service workers: The Progressive Web App should have a mechanism (e.g. through a service worker) to help control traffic when the network isn’t there or isn’t reliable. The app should be able to work independent of network.

   + Secure: A secure connection (HTTPS) over your site makes sure all traffic is as safe as a native app. A secure endpoint also allows the service worker to securely take action on the behalf of your app.
        
## Running across platforms

### Platforms that support:

Progressive web applications are progressively enhanced to function like native apps on supporting platforms, that is because the qualities of a PWA combine the best of the web and native apps, so PWAs can be supported as websites or web applications in platforms like Windows, Android , iOS or Mac.

### Running PWA in a browser:

PWAs aren't very different that a web application, when you access to a PWA you will see the same as a simple web application.
After complete this lab, your PWA will looks like this:
