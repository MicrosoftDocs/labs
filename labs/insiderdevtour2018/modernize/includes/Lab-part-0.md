What will this lab cover
------------------------

In this lab you will learn how to start modernizing your desktop apps for
Windows 10. You will start by working with a Windows Presentation Foundation
(WPF) app, but the same principles apply to a Windows Forms (WinForms) app.

### Distribution and versioning

You are now able to package your desktop apps in the same way as Universal
Windows Platform (UWP) apps. This enables a more secure, trusted, and flexible
way of distributing your app.

### UI modernization

This step will demonstrate how to add a modern WebView to your app based upon
the EdgeHTML rendering engine. This WebView supports the latest web standards
such as HTML5, and CSS3.

### Adaptive Cards

Adaptive Cards are a new way for developers to exchange card content in a common
and consistent way. You will discover how new cards can be designed, followed by
how to consume them from WPF - and finally how you make these cards actionable
through input fields.

### Windows 10 APIs

Sending local Toast Notifications from WPF is now possible by consuming UWP SDK.
Take advantage of Action Center as a single place to inform our users on useful
information happening in the apps. You will add such functionality from WPF and
send a local Toast Notification.
