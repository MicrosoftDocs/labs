What will this lab cover
========================

The following steps provided in this guide will cover how WPF apps can be
leveraged with the latest technologies available in Windows 10.

Step 1: UI modernization
------------------------

This step will showcase how to insert Edge-powered web views into WPF to enjoy
the latest Web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, etc. We’ll start by adding an existing
web view which isn’t fully compatible with such and move to an external
component to take advantage of them.

Step 2: Adaptive Cards
----------------------

Adaptive Cards are a new way for developers to exchange card content in a common
and consistent way. We’ll cover how new cards can be designed, followed by how
to consume them from WPF, by finally interacting with our users through input
fields.

Step 3: Distribution and versioning
-----------------------------------

Apart from distributing UWP apps through Windows Store, now it’s also possible
to pack Win32 ones --as such made with WPF-- to provide a seamless set-up User
Experience, even going through the Windows Store it-self. We’ll package and
version our WPF app for distribution, enabling automatic updates.
