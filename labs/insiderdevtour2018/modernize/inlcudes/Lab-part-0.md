# What will this lab cover

The following steps provided in this guide will cover how WPF apps can be
leveraged with the latest technologies available in Windows 10.

Step 1: UI modernization
------------------------

This step will showcase how to insert Edge-powered web views into WPF to enjoy
the latest Web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, etc. We’ll start by adding an existing
web view which isn’t fully compatible with such and move to an external
component to take advantage of them.

Step 2: Adaptive Cards
----------------------

Adaptive Cards are a new way for developers to exchange card content in a common
and consistent way. We’ll cover how new cards can be designed, followed by how
to consume them from WPF, by finally interacting with our users through input
fields.

Step 3: TO DO
-------------

(To be defined once we clear out what to do with MSIX.)
