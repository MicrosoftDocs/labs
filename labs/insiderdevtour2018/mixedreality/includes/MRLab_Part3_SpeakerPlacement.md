<!-- ## 3. Speaker Placement App --> 

The speaker placement app that we are building will have the following end-user functionality:
- Using the motion controllers, the user will be able to teleport and move around a virtual living room.  
- They will also be able to select speakers, move and rotate them, and turn them on and off to hear the Spatial Sound around the room. 




We have provided assets for the models and music listed below: 
    
*   Prefabs -> RoomPrefab.prefab - This is the virtual living room for the immersive headset.
*   Models -> Speaker.3DS - This is the model for our speakers which we will turn into a working prefab.
*   Audio -> ChillBlueLagoon.mp3 - Our music but you could use any .mp3, .ogg, .wav or .aiff file.


The rest of the functionality will be implemented using the Mixed Reality Toolkit. You will use features in the toolkit to add the interactions.
