## 3. Speaker Placement App

In this lab, we will be building a spatial sound experience focused on moving speakers around a living room. 

The user will be able to teleport and move around a virtual living room (or whatever room they are located in if running the app on HoloLens). They will also be able to move and rotate each speaker and turn them on or off. 

We have provided assets for the models and music listed below, and the rest we will create with help from the Mixed Reality Toolkit.
    
*   Prefabs -> RoomPrefab.prefab - This is the virtual living room for the HMDU.
*   Models -> Speaker.3DS - This is the model for our speakers which we will turn into a working prefab.
*   Audio -> ChillBlueLagoon.mp3 - Our music but you could use any .mp3, .ogg, .wav or .aiff file.
