**Azure Functions** is an event driven, compute-on-demand experience that extends the existing Azure application platform with capabilities to implement the code triggered by events occurring in Azure or third-party service as well as on-premises systems. Azure Functions allows developers to take action by connecting to data sources or messaging solutions thus making it easy to process and react to events. Developers can leverage Azure Functions to build HTTP-based API endpoints accessible by a wide range of applications, mobile and IoT devices.
